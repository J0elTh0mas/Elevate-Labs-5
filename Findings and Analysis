When observing the pcap file it can be understood that there is heavy traffic flowing through the desktop.

That being said a few main protocols that can be noted are:-
  TCP  : Known as Transmission control protocol. This protocol is used in many cases that require reliability and accuracy. This protocols begins with
         the connection being established using a three way handshake that ensures that both users are properly connected. This also ensures that no packets
         lost in transit as it will ensure that the packets are delivered in the right order and will re-transmit any missing packets. This can be seen in the 
         use cases of websites, file trasnfers and remote logins.
  DNS  : Domain Name Service, this allows for users to convert ip addresses into human readable website names. So when the user uses a web browser 
        he can input a name of website and then the broswer will query this name with a known DNS resolver and then obtains the ip address of the website
        this makes it very useful in everday use.
  UDP  : User Datagram Protocol, this can be seen to the opposite of TCP in terms of usage as the users using this protocol do not need to establish a
         closed connection. This protocol sends the packets individually with there being no acknowledgement of the packet being received. This is used in
         applications such as streaming or for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
  ICMP : This is known as Internet Control Message Protocol, it is used to perform network diagnostics and other control messages. This mainly used for
         diagnostics and troubleshooting you will not see this used for normal network use. 
  ARP  : Address Resolution Protocol, is used to translate ip addresses to mac addresses which is the hardware address. This makes it so that the system knows
         which system to send data to on the local network.
